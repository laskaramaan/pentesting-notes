# Clickjacking:

<code style="color : darkOrange">What is ClickJacking or UI redressing attack? Explain the root cause, impact and remediation.</code>

click jacking happens when the target application can be loaded in iframe.

Attackers can fool victim users into thinking they are clicking on one thing when they are actually clicking on another. This will be achieved by putting target application in hidden/transparent iframe of attacker controlled malicious web page where the visible frame has some content sitting on top of the target application. When Victim user clicks on the top frame's html elements, actually they will end up clicking he elements of target application which is loaded in the iframe behind. Thus attacker will be able to hijack the mouse clicks of the victim user.

Somewhat similar to CSRF, but here all operations cannot be forged but only the sensitive operations which need user clicks can be hijacked. Also anti CSRF mecanism cannot prevent ClickJacking.

<code style="color : aquamarine">Remediations:</code>

using X-Frame-Options or Content Security Policy (CSP) headers the application can be prevented being loaded within iframes of untrusted domains.

Common uses of CSP frame-ancestors:

`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';`

This prevents any domain from framing the content. This setting is recommended unless a specific need has been identified for framing.

`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';`

This only allows the current site to frame the content.

`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' \*.somesite.com https://myfriend.site.com;`

This allows the current site, as well as any page on somesite.com (using any protocol), and only the page myfriend.site.com, using HTTPS only on the default port (443).
