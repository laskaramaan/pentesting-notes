# Scanning tools and tactics

## TCP vs UDP

### TCP:

1. Connection-oriented
2. Has a handshake
3. Udsed on applications requiring high reliability
4. Eg. HTTP, FTP, Telnet

### UDP:

1. Connectionless
2. No handshake
3. sed on applications requiring a fast connection
4. Eg. DNS, DHCP, SNMP

## Wireshark:

Wireshark is used for network analysis and packet sniffing. Ethical hackers use Wireshark to examine network traffic, capture packets, and analyze the data flowing through a network

1. `wireshark&`: It will open wireshark tool
2. click on "start capturing packets (blue icon)"

## 3-way handshake

SYN
SYN-ACK
ACK

## Stealth mode (Nowadays its not stealthy anymore...normally also scanning is done this way only)

SYN
SYN-ACK
RST

## N-map

`nmap -T4 <ip-address>`:
T1-T5=> T1 is slowest speed scan and T5 is the fastest speed scan
Here since we did not mentioned port, it will scan top 1000 ports

`nmap -T4 -A -p- <ip-address> `:
-T4 is speed
-A enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning and traceroute
-p- means all ports

<!--  -->

**Staging:** It is a tactic to improve the scanning..First scan quickly and then scan more tachnically

eg.
`nmap -T4 -p- 192.168.168.128` : Here we got that port 22 is open
Nmap scan report for 192.168.168.128
Host is up (0.000055s latency).
Not shown: 65534 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open ssh

`nmap -T4 -A -p22 192.168.168.128`: Here we -A but and port 22 only
Nmap scan report for 192.168.168.128
Host is up (0.0014s latency).

PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 9.4p1 Debian 1 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
| 256 4d:09:38:23:42:7e:e3:0b:99:61:47:70:bd:de:46:18 (ECDSA)
|\_ 256 1e:4d:c6:6b:f1:2c:1e:e7:ee:3f:cd:a5:59:9b:83:d3 (ED25519)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

<!--  -->

`nmap -sU -T4 <ip-address>` : it is UDP scan , will scan top 1000 ports
