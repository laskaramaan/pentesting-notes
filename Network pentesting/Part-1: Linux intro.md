# Linux commands

## Imp commands:

`grep`:
`histroy`:
`echo`:
`rm`:
`touch`:
`curl ifconfig.me`: This command is used to get my own ip-address
`ls -la`: This will list all the files and folders with the permisions in a directory including
the hidden ones
`chmod +x <file_name>`

## Imp files

`cat /etc/passwd`: In etc/passwd file we can see the user names, their UIDs

`cat /etc/shadow`: In etc/shadow file we can see the user names, their hash

## Common network commands

`ifconfig`: to see the ip address

`ping`

`netstat -ano`: It shows you all the ports that are open and it shows you what's connected to those ports

## Installing some imp tools

`apt install git -y`

`apt install ftp`

### Installing impacket

`apt purge *impacket*` : To delete pre-installed impacket
`mkdirt opt`
`cd opt`
`git clone https://github.com/fortra/impacket.git`
`pip install .`

## Starting up a webserver temporarily

`ifconfig`: Using this command we will find the inet ip-address, in my case it was: 192.168.168.128

`service apache2 start`: After entering this command we will open the ipnet address in web browser..and woalaa...it's loading

`service ssh start`

`service postgresql start`

`service apache2 stop`: To stop the webserver

```
// these services will start automatically when the system turns on

systemctl enable ssh
systemctl enable postgresql
```

## Write a script to ping to my own ip address

First we will find our ip address.

`curl ifconfig.me`: This will give me my ip address (117.205.180.72)

`ping -c 1 117.205.180.72  > ip.txt` :

    * Here ```-c 1``` option tells ping to send only one packet to the target.

    * ```> ip.txt``` means that the ping will command will be saved in ip.txt file

`cat ip.txt`: It will run the command which is saved in the ip.txt file

## Write a script to do IPsweep for an IP range 1-254

`nano ipsweep.sh`: This will open nano text editor

```
#!/bin/bash

for ip in `seq 1 72`; do
ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
done

```
