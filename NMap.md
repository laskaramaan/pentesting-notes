# NMap

jab bhi hum nmap run krte hai, hume kuch chizo ki jarurat padhti hai

1. IP/SUBNET (<= Mendatory) [note: SUBNET is a group of IPs in a network]
2. Port
3. Scan type
4. Scan timings
5. Output types

## Target

`nmap <target>`

e.g. of target:

1. single IP⇒ nmap 1.2.3.4
2. Subnet range⇒ nmap 1.2.3.4/8
3. IP range⇒ nmap 1.2.3.4-8
4. specific IPs⇒ nmap 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8
5. text file⇒ nmap -iL host.txt
6. domain⇒ nmap abc.com

## Ports

`nmap <target> [port/s]`

**Note:** agar ports mention nhi kiya to 1000 most common ports

1. simple port⇒ nmap <target> -P80 [note: -P is to mention port]
2. sequential port⇒ nmap <target> -P20-30
3. distributed only⇒ nmap <target> -P80,22,111
4. service specific⇒ nmap <target> -P http
5. All ports⇒ nmap <target> -P-

## Scan Techniques

`nmap <target> [Scan technique]`

1. TCP connect scan: -sT
2. TCP SYN Scan: sS
3. Null Scan: sN
4. Ping Scan: sP
5. UDP scan: sU

## Scan Status

1. OPEN
2. CLOSE
3. **FILTERED:** This status indicates that Nmap was unable to determine if the port is open or closed due to a firewall or other network filtering device actively blocking or dropping the probe packets. This can be an indication of a potential firewall or other network filtering device in place.
4. OPEN | FILTERED
5. CLOSE | FILTERED
6. **UNFILTERED:** This status indicates that the port is either open or closed. This means that Nmap was able to determine the status of the port without any interference from a firewall or other network filtering device. This can be an indication that there is no firewall or network filtering device actively blocking or dropping the probe packets.

## Scan Timings

Jab hum nmap run krte hai tab “scan timings” ye batata hai ki humara scan kitna fast ya slow chalega

`nmap <target> -T1`

T0⇒Paranoid

T1⇒Sneaky

T2⇒Polite

T3⇒Normal

T4⇒Agressive

T5⇒Insane

## Misc

**Service-version: (-sV)** `nmap -sV <target>`

**OS version: (-O)** `nmap -O <target>`

**Verbosity: (-v)** `nmap -v <target>`
